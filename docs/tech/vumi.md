# Vumi

We build on top of our Vumi platform for SMS, USSD and other messaging protocols.

[Vumi][] is a scalable messaging engine which we use for SMS, USSD and other messaging
protocols.

We [build Vumi in a container][docker-vumi] and [push it to Docker Hub][dockerhub].

[Vumi Go][] is a hosted version of Vumi. Where Vumi gives you the tools to
build large scale messaging applications, Vumi Go provides you with a working
environment that is already integrated into numerous countries.

Apps can be written for Vumi Go, to power messaging campaigns or information systems.
These apps can be written in Javascript to run in a sandboxed environment (which is
our preferred option) or in Python.

See the [Vumi Go][] documentation as well as the [JS Sandbox toolkit][] documentation for
writing apps.
