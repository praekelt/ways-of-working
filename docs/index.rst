Welcome to Praekelt.org's technical ways of working documentation!
==================================================================

Hey, hopefully you're here because you're about to embark on a
project with us.

Here are some bits & pieces of documentation to help you get up to speed
with our ways of working, the tools we use, processes we follow and the
things we expect from you when doing projects.

If anything is unclear or plain wrong please do notify us, or better yet
submit a pull request to the repository!

Enjoy!
