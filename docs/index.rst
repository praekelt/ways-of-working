Welcome to Praekelt Ways of Working's documentation!
====================================================

Hey, hopefully you're here because you're about to embark on a
project with us.

Here are some bits & pieces of documentation to help you get up to speed
with our ways of working, the tools we use, processes we follow and the
things we would be expecting from you when doing projects.

If anything is unclear, or plain wrong, please do notify us or better yet:
submit a pull request to the repository!

Enjoy!
