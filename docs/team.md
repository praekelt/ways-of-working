# Engineering teams

Engineering is split into 3 teams.

## Health

The health team works on:

- [MomConnect South Africa](projects/momconnect.html)
- HelloMama Nigeria
- FamilyConnect Uganda
- NurseConnect South Africa

## Youth

The youth team works on:

- Springster

## Site reliability engineering (SRE)

The SRE team is responsible for hosting and infrastructure.

Because Praekelt deals with health and medical information, we normally
use infrastructure hosted inside the countries where we operate:

- [South Africa](infrastructure/south-africa.html)
- Nigeria
- Uganda
- Amazon Web Services eu-west-1
