# Engineering teams

Engineering is split into 4 squads (which can rotate
across different work) and the SRE team.

## Site reliability engineering (SRE)

The SRE team is responsible for hosting and infrastructure.

Because Praekelt deals with health and medical information, we normally
use infrastructure hosted inside the countries where we operate:

- [South Africa](infrastructure/south-africa.html)
- [Nigeria](infrastructure/nigeria.html)
- Uganda
- Amazon Web Services eu-west-1
