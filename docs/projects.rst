Things you need to know when starting a project
===============================================

Sometimes there's a rush to get a project started. To spare yourself
future trouble here's a checklist of things you need to have before
starting any work.

1. You need to have been issued a purchase order.
2. You need to have been given a Scope of Work describing the thing you
   are to be building.
3. You need to have agreed to the timelines, estimates and deliverables
   described in the Scope of Work. If there are any ambiguities in any of
   the wording they need to be resolved before you start.
4. You need to have a clear picture of which stats need to be collected
   for the project and how those are to be stored to enable the people
   wanting access to those stats to do the type of analysis they need to do.
   This differs per project so make sure you take the time to do this properly.
